# Formup

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/formup.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formup) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Formup integrates Formik with Yup, reducing the code overhead needed to create your forms to zero!

It provides the best of both worlds for all of your forms so you can create, initialize and validate any form in only a few lines of code 📝💯.

Of course, you'll still have all validation options and functionality from Yup and all helpers from Formik. Formup is essentialy a bridge between these two libraries so that you can work easily without worrying about writing any middleware.
